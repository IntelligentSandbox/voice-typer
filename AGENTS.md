## Environment
You are always run from the root dir of this project. Use Unix commands and forward
slashes for paths (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`) and reference paths relatively, e.g. `./src/audio_pipeline.h`.

Detect the host platform at the start of each session by running `uname -s`, since the
same project is built on both Windows and NixOS/Linux and the tooling differs:
- `Linux`            -> native Linux (NixOS). Native paths like `/home/<user>/VoiceTyper`.
                       The nix flake packages (.#default, .#cuda, .#portable-x11,
                       .#portable-wayland, .#cuda-portable-x11, .#cuda-portable-wayland)
                       are invoked directly via `nix build`;
                       `tools/release.sh --linux` orchestrates them remotely for releases.
- `MINGW*` / `MSYS*` -> Windows under git bash. Paths like `/c/dir1/dir2`.
                       Use `tools/release.sh` for the Visual Studio build + package flow.

Match build commands and any platform-specific source (`src/*_win32.*`, `src/*_linux.*`)
to the detected platform rather than assuming one.

## Project Overview
This is a voice typing application that runs as a native application on the host OS.
It performs real-time audio transcription using a locally hosted, in-memory Speech-to-Text model
via **Whisper.cpp** (an external project and core dependency).
The application's primary responsibility is facilitating user control of:
    audio input -> Whisper.cpp model -> insert text into focused text input field (if available)

Build, package, and release are all handled by a single script (run from the
repo root). Flags compose:

    tools/release.sh                  build + package Windows (cpu + cuda)  -> dist/
    tools/release.sh --release        build + package + create a DRAFT GitHub release
    tools/release.sh --tag --release  cut v<VERSION> tag + build + package + DRAFT release
    tools/release.sh ... --linux      also build + package portable Linux (cpu + cuda,
                                      each as x11 and wayland SDL2 variants) on the
                                      remote NixOS box over ssh
                                      (VOICETYPER_NIX_SSH, default 'rock')

The script inlines the Visual Studio (cmake) / 7z / WiX MSI steps for Windows
and the nix flake builds for Linux. Only DRAFT releases are ever created
automatically — publish from the GitHub UI. `--ccache` reuses object files across
CUDA nix rebuilds (needs a ccache dir nixbld can write; default
/var/cache/voicetyper-ccache, or $CCACHE_DIR).

For a quick dev build without packaging, invoke cmake directly — always use the
Ninja generator (never "Visual Studio 17 2022", which is many times slower).
Ninja needs the MSVC environment, so drive it through vcvars via a batch file
(calling vcvars64.bat inline from git bash mangles the quoting):
    build/cpu          -> cmake -S . -B build/cpu -G Ninja
    build/cuda-plugin  -> cmake -S . -B build/cuda-plugin -G Ninja -DVOICETYPER_BUILD_CUDA_PLUGIN=ON
Both dirs already hold Ninja caches; reconfigure in place rather than creating
new build dirs. Then, from a batch file:
    call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
    cmake --build build/cpu && cmake --build build/cuda-plugin
(Without vcvars, linking fails with `LNK1181: cannot open input file 'kernel32.lib'`.)

On NixOS the individual flake packages can still be built directly for dev:
    nix build .#default | .#cuda | .#portable-x11 | .#portable-wayland |
               .#cuda-portable-x11 | .#cuda-portable-wayland

The portable packages produce flat, Windows-style distributable directories
(dynamically linked ELFs + the full .so closure + a bundled ld-linux, with the
CUDA variant adding a `cuda/` subdir holding `libggml-cuda.so` + cublas/cudart).
Each comes in an x11 and a wayland flavour that differ only in the bundled
SDL2's video driver; the app itself is display-server agnostic (software
renderer, clipboard-based text insertion).
`tools/release.sh --linux` tars them into
`VoiceTyper-v<VERSION>-x86_64-linux-{cpu,cuda}-{x11,wayland}.tar.gz`.
The top-level `VoiceTyper` is a `/bin/sh` launcher that execs the bundled
ld-linux on `VoiceTyper.elf`, so the bundle runs on most distros including
NixOS (it bypasses the kernel's PT_INTERP lookup, which fails there).

## Workflow
1. Read `.dev/tasks.md` at the start of every session. The user may give you an explicit request, which should take priority over the tasklist. However, if the tasklist contains items that may conflict with the one-off request, notify the user and ask what to do.
2. Work through tasks in order, top to bottom. Do not skip tasks.
3. For each task:
   a. Implement the change.
   b. Verify it passes all release build variations (e.g. cpu, cuda)
   c. Commit with: `git add -A && git commit -m "<task title>" -m "<brief description of what was done>"`
      - Use multiple `-m` flags for multiline messages.
      - Never use heredocs or command substitution in git commands.
   d. Mark the task complete in `.dev/tasks.md` by checking its checkbox as soon as the respective task is complete and commited in git.
4. Stop and report once all tasks are complete.

## Task Complexity
If a task is marked `[PLAN]` instead of `[ ]`, do not implement it.
Instead, decompose it into concrete sub-tasks, write them into `.dev/tasks.md`
replacing the `[PLAN]` entry, and stop for review before proceeding.

## Coding Guidelines

### Indentation & Formatting
- Use **tab characters** for indentation (not spaces)
- Exception: `*.nix` files use **2 spaces** per [Nix RFC 166](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0166-nix-formatting.md). Run `nixfmt` (available in the nix devShell via `nix develop`) to canonicalize.
- Use **LF line endings**
- Keep lines under **120 characters**; unroll onto multiple lines if needed

### Comments
- Do **not** insert comments unless explicitly directed to
- Do **not** remove existing code comments unless explicitly directed to

### Control Flow
- Use **early returns** where possible to reduce nesting/indentation
- Single and Multi-statement `if`/`else` bodies use curly brackets on **separate lines**
- Single-statement `for` loops **must** use curly brackets

### General
- Follow existing coding style and conventions already present in the codebase
