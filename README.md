Voice Typer aspires to be a native application that you can use to synthesize text
from your voice using on device NN models that can be used in any of your other 
desktop applications such as your web browser, note taking app, or even messaging
app that doesn't have a voice input feature. Later down the line, we can also have
custom user commands via keywords/keyphrases.
